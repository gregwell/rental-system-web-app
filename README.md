## Description:

Implementation of the rental management system created in a team of two. I was responsible for the client side (web application created in TypeScript, React - this repo) and my collegue was responsible for the employee side (desktop application written in Java). Beyond the implementation, we were both responsible for the design of the system (compare existing solutions, set the requirements for our system..)

## Engineering thesis:

The theoretical side was described in [our engineering thesis](/projekt-dyplomowy.pdf). The document language is Polish.

## Tech stack:

- **TypeScript**
- **React**
- MongoDB Atlas
- HTML5
- CSS (CSS-in-JS)
- Material-ui
- React Router

## Possible improvements:

- implement some global state management system like redux to tidy up the code
- clean up spaghetti code
